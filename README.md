# HR-Attrition-Predictor

This project is focused on predicting employee attrition using machine learning models. By analyzing HR analytics data, it aims to help organizations identify factors that contribute to employee turnover and take proactive steps to improve retention.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build and evaluate classification models that can predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on various HR-related attributes such as job satisfaction, working hours, salary, and more.

## 🧠 Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

Each model is trained and evaluated for performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## 📊 Features of the Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:
- Satisfaction Level
- Last Evaluation
- Number of Projects
- Average Monthly Hours
- Time Spent at Company
- Work Accident
- Promotion in Last 5 Years
- Department
- Salary
- Left (Target)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – model training and evaluation

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook includes detailed visual analysis using:
- Correlation heatmaps
- Bar plots for categorical features
- Distribution plots for numeric features

## ✅ Results & Evaluation

- Models are compared using accuracy scores.
- Random Forest showed the best overall performance.
- Feature importance is visualized to understand influential attributes in employee attrition.
